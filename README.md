# MathScript

This shell script was written for a college assignment. The module taught computer architecture and explored the Linux operating system. 

Notes about the assignment:
  - The module taught the Linux command line, tools and shells.
  - This assignment required the student to write a shell script that generates maths tables.  
  - The user should be able to:
    1. Enter one of the following operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division or exponent.
    2. Enter an operand between 1 and 15. 

Workflow
  - The shell script displays basic instructions and prompts the user to input an operator. 
  - The script then allows the user to input an operand from 1 to 15. 
  - After generating a Maths table based on the user’s input, the user can then enter another operand or return to select a different operator. 
  - The script gives feedback if the user inputs an incorrect operator or if the user inputs a number outside of the range given in the assignment brief. 
  - The script keeps looping while the user works on their Maths tables. 
  - The user can exit the script by entering ‘q’.
